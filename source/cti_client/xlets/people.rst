Importing contacts via CSV file
===============================

Imported files should have the following structure::

   firstname,lastname,number,email,company,fax,mobile
   John,Doe,5555551111,my@email,wazo,5555552222,5555553333

* The field order is not important.
* The file must be encoded in ``UTF-8``.
* Invalid lines of the CSV file will be skipped and an error will be displayed in the import report.


Exporting contacts via CSV file
===============================

The file has the same structure as the import file, with a supplementary field: ``id``, which is the
internal contact ID from Wazo.

* The first line (the list of field names) is ordered in alphabetical order.
* The file will be encoded in ``UTF-8``.


Copying the number or email address
===================================

It is possible to copy a contact's number or email address to the system's
clipboard. To do so, right click on a contact's action menu and select the value
you wish to copy.


.. note:: When using a mac without a right mouse button use `ctrl-Left click` to show the copy menu.
