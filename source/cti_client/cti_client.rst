What is the Wazo Client
=======================

The Wazo Client is an application that you install on your computer and is connected to the Wazo
server. This application offers the following features:

* search contacts and show their presence, phone status
* make calls through your phone (the Wazo Client is **NOT** a softphone, it is complementary to the
  phone)
* access your voicemail through your phone
* enable call forwards, call filtering
* show the history of your calls
* list conference rooms and members
* send faxes

It also offers some call center features:

* show screen popups or open URLs when you receive/answer a call
* list agents, queues, calls in queues
* login/logoff, pause/unpause other agents (for supervisors)
* listen/whisper to agents through you phone (for supervisors)

A lot of those features are modular and may be enabled for each user by choosing which :ref:`Xlets
<xlet-list>` they can see.

Connection Configuration
------------------------

.. figure:: images/configuration_connection.png
   :scale: 85%

This page allows the user to set his network information to connect to the xivo-ctid server.

* `Server` is the IP address of the server.
* `Backup server` is the IP address of the backup server.
* `Port` is the port on which xivo-ctid is listening for connections. (default: 5003)
* `STARTTLS` is used to specify that a secure connect should be used


Handling callto: and tel: URLs
==============================

The Wazo Client can handle telephone number links that appear in web pages. The client will
automatically dial the number when you click on a link.

.. note:: You must already be logged in for automatic dialing to work, otherwise the client will
           simply start up and wait for you to log in.

.. warning:: The option in the Wazo Client :menuselection:`Advanced --> Allow multiple instances
             of Wazo Client` must be disabled, else you will launch one new Wazo Client with every click.

Mac OS
------

``callto:`` links will work out-of-the-box in Safari and other web browsers
after installing the client.

``tel:`` links will open FaceTime after installing the client. To make the
Wazo Client the default application to open ``tel:`` URLs in Safari.

1. Open the FaceTime application
2. Connect using your apple account
3. Open the FaceTime preferences
4. Change the *Default for calls* entry to *wazoclient.app*


.. figure:: images/facetime_preference.png


.. note:: The ``tel:`` URL works out-of-the-box in versions of mac osx before 10.10.


Windows
-------

Wazo Client is associated with ``callto:`` and ``tel:`` upon installation. Installing other
applications afterward could end up overriding these associations.

* Windows Vista: :menuselection:`Start menu --> Control Panel --> Default Programs`, subsection Protocols
* Windows 7: :menuselection:`Start menu --> Control Panel --> Default Programs`, subsection Protocols
* Windows 10: :menuselection:`Start menu --> Settings --> System --> Default apps --> Choose default apps by protocol`

Ubuntu
------

Currently, ``callto:`` or ``tel:`` links are only supported in Firefox. There is no configuration
needed.

GNU/Linux Debian
----------------

Currently, ``callto:`` or ``tel:`` links are only supported in Firefox. If the Wazo Client is not
listed in the proposition when you open the link, browse your files to find
:file:`/usr/bin/wazoclient`.

Manual association in Firefox
-----------------------------

If, for some reason, Firefox does not recognize ``callto:`` or ``tel:`` URIs you can manually
associate them to the Wazo Client using the following steps:

1. Type ``about:config`` in the URL bar
2. Click the *I'll be careful, I promise !* button to close the warning
3. Right-click anywhere in the list and select *New -> Boolean*
4. Enter ``network.protocol-handler.external.callto`` as preference name
5. Select ``false`` as value
6. Repeat steps 3 to 6, but replace ``callto`` by ``tel`` at step 4

The next time that you click on a telephone link, Firefox will ask you to choose an application. You
will then be able to choose the Wazo Client for handling telephone numbers.
