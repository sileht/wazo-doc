# Message Bus

The message bus is used to receive events from Wazo. It is provided by
an
[AMQP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol)
0-9-1 broker (namely,
[RabbitMQ](http://previous.rabbitmq.com/v2_8_x/documentation.html)) that
is integrated in Wazo.

## Usage

### Websocket

The easiest way to listen for events is to use the
<span data-role="ref">Wazo WebSocket \<wazo-websocketd\></span>.

### Direct AMQP connection

At the moment, the AMQP broker only listen on the 127.0.0.1 address.
This means that if you want to connect to the AMQP broker from a distant
machine, you must modify the RabbitMQ server configuration, which is not
yet an officially supported operation. All events are sent to the *xivo*
exchange.

Otherwise, the default connection information is:

  - Virtual host: /
  - User name: guest
  - User password: guest
  - Port: 5672
  - Exchange name: xivo
  - Exchange type: topic

### Example

Here's an example of a simple client, in python, listening for
<span data-role="ref">bus-call\_created</span> events:

    import kombu
    
    from kombu.mixins import ConsumerMixin
    
    EXCHANGE = kombu.Exchange('xivo', type='topic')
    ROUTING_KEY = 'events.calls.*'
    
    
    class C(ConsumerMixin):
    
        def __init__(self, connection):
            self.connection = connection
    
        def get_consumers(self, Consumer, channel):
            return [Consumer(kombu.Queue(exchange=EXCHANGE, routing_key=ROUTING_KEY),
                    callbacks=[self.on_message])]
    
        def on_message(self, body, message):
            print('Received:', body)
            message.ack()
    
    
    def main():
        with kombu.Connection('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//') as conn:
            try:
                C(conn).run()
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                return
    
    
    main()

If you are new to AMQP, you might want to look at the [RabbitMQ
tutorial](http://previous.rabbitmq.com/v2_8_x/getstarted.html).

### Notes

Things to be aware when writing a client/consumer:

  - The published messages are not persistent. When the AMQP broker
    stops, the messages that are still in queues will be lost.

## Events

Events that are sent to the bus use a JSON serialization format with the
content-type application/json. For example, the CTI call\_form\_result
event looks like this:

    {"name": "call_form_result",
     "origin_uuid": "ca7f87e9-c2c8-5fad-ba1b-c3140ebb9be3",
     "data": {...}}

All events have the same basic structure, namely, a JSON object with 4
keys:

  - name  
    A string representing the name of the event. Each event type has a
    unique name.

  - required\_acl (optional)  
    Either a string or null. Currently used by xivo-websocketd to
    determine if a client can receive the event or not. See the
    <span data-role="ref">ws-events-acl</span> section for more
    information.

  - origin\_uuid  
    The uuid to identify the message producer.

  - data  
    The data specific part of the event. This is documented on a per
    event type; if not this is assumed to be null.

### AMI events

All AMI events are broadcasted on the bus.

  - routing key: ami.\<event name\>
  - event specific data: a dictionary with the content of the AMI event

Example event with binding key QueueMemberStatus:

    {
        "name": "QueueMemberStatus",
        "origin_uuid": "ca7f87e9-c2c8-5fad-ba1b-c3140ebb9be3",
        "data": {
            "Status": "1",
            "Penalty": "0",
