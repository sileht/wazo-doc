# xivo-provd REST API

This section describes the REST API provided by the xivo-provd
application.

If you want to interact with the REST API of the xivo-provd daemon that
is executing as part of Wazo, you should be careful on which operation
you are doing as to not cause stability problem to other parts of the
Wazo ecosystem. Mostly, this means being careful when editing or
deleting devices and configs.

By default, the REST API of xivo-provd is accessible only from localhost
on port 8666. No authentication is required.
