# REST API Quickstart

## Introduction

Wazo REST APIs are HTTP interfaces that allow you to programmatically
interact with Wazo. In order to access the REST APIs of Wazo, you need:

  - a Wazo server up and running
  - a browser
  - somewhere you can copy-paste text (ids, tokens, etc.)

## REST API Permissions

First of all, you must have permission to use the REST API. Create a
wazo-auth user and policy:

`POST /users {"purpose": "external_api", "username": "rest-api-test",
...}` `POST /policies {"acl_templates": ["#"], ...}` `PUT
/users/{user_uuid}/policies/{policy_uuid}`

  - `acl_templates`: `#` is a wildcard that gives access to every REST
    API. You may want to delete this account when you're done, to reduce
    risks of unauthorized access.

Save the form, and store the login/password somewhere for later use.

## Swagger UI

In this article, we will use the Swagger Web UI, a small web application
available in every Wazo installation since XiVO 15.10.

In your browser, go to `http://<wazo>/api`. You should see:

  - a list of available APIs
  - input boxes on the top, we will ignore those for now

The list of available APIs reflects the different modules of Wazo. Each
module is a Python process that serves its own REST API. We will
concentrate on two of them:

  - wazo-auth
  - xivo-confd

wazo-auth is the daemon responsible for authentication. Every API is
protected by a token-based authentication mechanism. In order to use any
REST API, we will need a valid authentication token, obtained from
wazo-auth.

xivo-confd is the daemon responsible for Wazo configuration. Its REST
API allows you to read and modify users, lines, extensions, groups, etc.
This is the programatic equivalent of the Wazo web interface. However,
the xivo-confd REST API is not yet complete, and not all aspects of Wazo
configuration are available in xivo-confd.

## HTTPS certificates

Almost all REST APIs use encryption and are available via HTTPS.
Unfortunately, Wazo does not come with a trusted certificate. So you
have to manually trust the self-signed certificate of your Wazo. To that
end:

1.  Click on wazo-auth in the menu on the left.

2.  You should see an error
        like:
    
        Can't read from server. It may not have the appropriate access-control-origin settings.
    
    This is expected. This is the kind of error (quite misleading,
    admittedly) you get when the certificate is not trusted.

3.  Copy the URL you see in the text box at the top of the page,
    something like: `https://wazo:9497/1.1/api/api.yml` and paste it in
    your browser.

4.  Accept the HTTPS certificate validation exception.

5.  You should see a YAML text file describing the xivo-confd API.

6.  Go back to `http://wazo/api`.

7.  Click on wazo-auth again.

8.  Now you should see a list of sections for the wazo-auth REST API,
    like `backends` or `token`

9.  Repeat the whole procedure for xivo-confd (the port in the URL will
    be different, and the REST API description will take longer to
    load), and you should be ready to go.

## Authentication token

Let's ask wazo-auth for an authentication token:

1.  Choose the `wazo-auth` service in the list of REST APIs
2.  In the top-right text box of the page (left to the "Explore"
    button), fill "token" with the `rest-api-test:password`: those
    credentials are the ones from the Web Services Access you created
    earlier.
3.  Go to the `POST /tokens` section and click on the yellow box to the
    right of the `body` parameter. This will pre-fill the `body`
    parameter.
4.  In the `body` parameter, set:
      - `expiration` to the number of seconds for the token to be valid
        (e.g. 3600 for one hour). After the expiration time, you will
        need to re-authenticate to get a new token.
5.  Click `Try it out` at the end of the section. This will make an HTTP
    request to wazo-auth.
6.  You should see a response to your HTTP request, containing a JSON
    object. In the response, you should see a `token` attribute. That
    little string is your authentication token. Save it somewhere, in
    case you need it later.
7.  Copy-paste the `token` attribute in the top-right input box,
    replacing the `rest-api-test:password`. Note that you don't need to
    click the Explore button to accept the change of token.

## Use the xivo-confd REST API

Now that we have an authentication token, we are ready to use the REST
API.

1.  Click on xivo-confd in the left menu
2.  Choose a REST API endpoint, like
    <span data-role="menuselection">users --\> GET /users</span> and
    click `Try it out`

And that's it, you are ready to use any REST API with your
authentication token.

<div class="note">

<div class="admonition-title">

Note

</div>

Be aware that this token will expire, and that you will need to get a
new one when that happens. You can take a look at
<https://auth.wazo.community> for an easier manual token generation
process. Note that the `auth.wazo.community` server will never know the
tokens that you generate, you browser will ask your Wazo directly.

</div>

<div class="warning">

<div class="admonition-title">

Warning

</div>

Also, note that this authentication token gives **all permissions** to
anyone who knows it. Same goes for the account password we created
earlier. Remember to delete this account, or at least restrict
permissions when you're done.
