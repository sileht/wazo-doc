# CSV Migration

This page describes how to migrate CSV files from the legacy format to
the new format. Consult the [API
documentation](http://api.wazo.community) on user imports for further
details.

## CSV Data

>   - Only data encoded as UTF-8 will be accepted
>   - The pipe delimiter (`|`) has been replaced by a comma (`,`)
>   - Double-quotes (`"`) must be escaped by writing them twice (e.g
>     `Robert ""Bob"" Jenkins`)

## Field names

Fields have been renamed in the new CSV format. Use the following table
to rename your fields. Fields marked as **N/A** are no longer supported.
