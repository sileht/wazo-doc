# Upgrade notes

## 19.07

  - Upgrade from version older than 15.01 are not supported anymore.
  - If a group or queue was named `general`, then it has been renamed
    with one or more suffix `_` (e.i. `general_`). The name `general` is
    no more allowed.
  - xivo-sysconfd is now async by default. If you rely on Asterisk being
    reloaded when configuring resources. See
    <span data-role="ref">sysconfd-configuration</span> to set the
    synchronous option to true
  - The configuration of `rest_api` section for `xivo-confd`
    configuration file has changed. See [xivo-confd
    changelog](https://github.com/wazo-pbx/xivo-confd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1907)
    for more information.
  - xivo-ctid-ng was renamed to wazo-calld. All users that are logged in
    Wazo must logout and log back in, to apply the change of
    authorizations names (ACL).
  - Skills are migrated to the tenant of the agent with whom they are
    associated. If a skill was not associated with an agent, is has been
    deleted.
  - All the existing skill rules have been associated to the tenant of
    the first queue found in the database. If no queue was found,
    meaning there was no queue, the skill rules were deleted.
  - The skill rules internal names have been changed to use the format
    `skillrule-<id>`. If you were using custom dialplan with a
    preprocess subroutine to handle your skill rules, we recommend
    removing it and using the REST API (see
    <span data-role="ref">skill-apply</span>). If you really want to
    keep it, you must change the name used in the variable
    `XIVO_QUEUESKILLRULESET` to use the new format.

Consult the [19.07
Roadmap](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10022)
for more information

## 19.06

  - All administration interfaces `xivo-web-interface` and
    `wazo-admin-ui` have been removed
  - Agents are now multi-tenant. Agents created using the rest API that
    were not logged into a queue and that were not associated to a user
    have been deleted.

Consult the [19.06
Roadmap](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10020)
for more information

## 19.05

  - `xivo-provd-client` is now deprecated. You must use
    `wazo-provd-client` instead.
  - The `tenant_name` variable has been removed from the call recording
    templates in favor of the `tenant_uuid`. If the `tenant_name` was
    used in the directory name, a symlink can be used to keep the same
    name.
  - All chat messages will be deleted after the upgrade. There are now
    handled by `wazo-chatd` instead of `xivo-ctid-ng` and `MongooseIM`.

Consult the [19.05
Roadmap](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10017)
for more information

## 19.04

  - `wazo-dird` is now configured using its REST API. The previous
    configuration have been removed and a new configuration has been
    automatically generated based on the current tenants and internal
    contexts.

  - `xivo-provisioning` and `xivo-confd` now implement multi-tenant
    devices. Existing devices are migrated automatically to the tenant
    of their first associated line. If a device is in autoprov mode, it
    will be migrated to the default tenant.
    
    See <span data-role="ref">intro-provisioning</span> for more
    information on how device tenants are handled.

  - Call pickups that have been created using the REST API or
    wazo-admin-ui have the interceptors and targets mixed up. Since call
    pickups created using the "normal" web interface did not have that
    bug, we could not fix the existing configuration automatically.
    Faulty call pickups will have to be edited and users moved from
    interceptors to targets and vice versa.

  - The provisioning option
    <span data-role="ref">dhcp-integration</span> is now enabled by
    default. There is no REST API to disable this feature.

  - User and device presences are now handled by `wazo-chatd` instead of
    `xivo-ctid-ng`.

  - `xivo-ctid` has been removed, therefore the `wazoclient` will not
    connect anymore.

Roadmap](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10014)
for more information

## 19.03

  - xivo-provisioning now uses YAML configuration. The defaults can be
    overriden in the /etc/xivo-provd/conf.d/ directory. See
    <span data-role="ref">configuration-files</span>.

## 19.02

  - For wazo-auth backend developers: The API to implement a wazo-auth
    backend has been changed in 18.02. The compatibility code that
    allowed old backends to keep working has been removed.
      - The get\_ids method has been removed.
  - ACL templating has been modified: when generating multiple ACLs with
    one template, ACL were separated with `\n`. They are now separated
    with `:` (colon). `\n` is not interpreted anymore. You should hence
    replace any `\n` with `:` in your ACLs.
  - xivo-provisioning now uses wazo-auth to authenticate all requests
    and uses HTTPS. It is no longer possible to deactivate
    authentication. Therefore, all calls to the REST API will need to be
    made using HTTPS and a token generated with wazo-auth.
  - xivo-provd-cli has been updated to remove the username and password
    command line arguments since they are no longer used.

## 19.01

  - The xivo wazo-dird backend has been renamed wazo. Custom directory
    configuration files will have to be updated.
  - The procedure for custom certificates, especially for Let's Encrypt
    certificates, has been simplified. See
    <span data-role="ref">https\_certificate</span>.
  - The xivo\_admin backend in wazo-auth has been removed. All
    xivo\_admin users have been migrated to wazo\_user backend.

    from queues
  - People using the xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019 will have to upgrade to
    version 1.9.2 or later
  - The xivo\_service backend in wazo-auth has been removed. All
    xivo\_service users have been migrated to wazo\_user backend.
  - The fail2ban jail was renamed from `asterisk-xivo` to
    `asterisk-wazo`.
  - Wazo now uses res\_pjsip instead of chan\_sip.
      - All custom lines with interface `SIP/something` must be changed
        to `PJSIP/something`

  - `xivo-dird` has been renamed `wazo-dird`
      - The custom configuration has been moved to
        `/etc/wazo-dird/conf.d/`.
      - The log file has been renamed to `wazo-dird.log`.
      - The NGINX proxy has been recreated in
        `/etc/nginx/locations/https-enabled/wazo-dird`
      - Entrypoint for custom plugin has been renamed to `wazo_dird.*`.
  - `xivo-dird-client` has been renamed `wazo-dird-client`
      - If you were using the xivo-dird-client in your python code you
        should use the wazo-dird-client which has the same interface at
        the moment.
  - wazo-dird now uses a token to authenticate when doing searches on
    xivo-confd
      - See <span data-role="ref">dird-backend-wazo</span> if you have
        customized configuration files in /etc/wazo-dird/sources.d or
        /etc/wazo-dird/conf.d for a source of type xivo
      - If you are using custom certificates you will have to modify
        your directory configuration to add your certificate. See
        <span data-role="ref">https\_certificate</span> for more
        information in the Use your own
        certificate section.
  - Authentication policies now have a tenant\_uuid and the relationship
    between tenants and policies has been removed. If you did use
    policies with tenant association, the policy is now associated to
    one of its tenant. This feature is not used yet in Wazo, so most
    likely you are not affected.

Consult the [18.05
Roadmap](https://projects.wazo.community/versions/275) for more
information.

## 18.04

  - Invalid user email will be deleted automatically during upgrade.
  - Asterisk configuration files can now be customized in the
    <span data-role="file">/etc/asterisk/\*.d/</span> directories. If
    you had custom configuration in
    <span data-role="file">/etc/asterisk/\*.conf</span> you will have to
    create a new file in the corresponding .d directory to use your
    customized configuration. Files named
    <span data-role="file">\*.conf.dpkg-old</span> will be left in
    <span data-role="file">/etc/asterisk</span> if this operation is
    required. See <span data-role="ref">asterisk-configuration</span>
    for more details.
  - The user authentication has been updated with the following impacts:
      - User's password cannot be returned in plain text anymore.
      - Users export (export CSV) cannot export password anymore.
      - Time to import users (import CSV) has been increased
        significatively if the field password is provided.
      - Fields username and password in xivo-confd API /users don't have
        impact anymore on authentication and must be considered as
        invalid. To change these values, use wazo-auth API instead.
      - Fields enabled for xivo-confd API /users/\<user\_id\>/cti don't
        have impact anymore on authentication and must be considered as
        invalid. To change this value, use wazo-auth API instead.
      - In wazo-auth, the backend xivo\_user has been removed.
      - In xivo-ctid, the default authentication backend is now
        wazo\_user.
  - Default phone passwords are now auto-generated. Switchboard users
    with a Snom device will now have to add a configuration file to
    store the username and password.
  - Creating user using the REST API now requires the Wazo-Tenant HTTP
    header when the created user is not in the same tenant has its
    creator.
  - Tenants have been automatically created to match configured
    entities.

Consult the [18.04
Roadmap](https://projects.wazo.community/versions/274) for more
information.

## 18.03

  - If you have a <span data-role="ref">custom certificate
    configured\<https\_certificate\></span>, you will need to add a new
    symlink for wazo-upgrade:
    
        mkdir -p /etc/wazo-upgrade/conf.d
        ln -s "/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml" "/etc/wazo-upgrade/conf.d/010-custom-certificate.yml"

  - Default passwords for phones' web interfaces have been changed. You
    can change the password in
    <span data-role="menuselection">Configuration --\> Provisioning --\>
    Template device</span>.

  - The default NAT option in General SIP settings has been
    automatically changed from `auto_force_rport` to
    `auto_force_rport,auto_comedia`. This makes NAT configuration easier
    but has no impact on environments without NAT.
    
      - In the rare cases where you want to keep `nat=auto_force_rport`
        you must explicitly change this value in the administation
        interface <span data-role="menuselection">Services --\> IPBX
        --\> General Settings
        \--\> SIP Protocol</span> in tab Default. See [Asterisk sip.conf
        sample](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/15.1.1/configs/samples/sip.conf.sample#L869)
        for more informations.

  - The NAT configuration of every SIP line and SIP trunk has been
    automatically changed from `nat=auto_force_rport` to nothing, so
    that they inherit this setting from the General SIP settings.

Consult the [18.03
Roadmap](https://projects.wazo.community/versions/272) for more
information.

## 18.02

  - For wazo-auth backend developers: The API to implement a wazo-auth
    backend has changed. Old implementations have to be updated. If the
    BaseAuthenticationBackend class was used as a base class for the
    backend the get\_metadata method from the base class will use
    get\_ids to generate the result of get\_metadata.
      - The get\_ids method has been removed.
      - The get\_metadata method has been added.

Consult the [18.02
Roadmap](https://projects.wazo.community/versions/264) for more
information.

## 18.01

  - **Debian has been upgraded from version 8 (jessie) to 9 (stretch).**
    Please consult the following detailed upgrade notes for more
    information:

> <div class="toctree">
> 
> 18.01/stretch
> 
> </div>

  - If you *did not* setup a custom X.509 certificate for HTTPS (e.g.
    from Let's Encrypt), the certificate will be regenerated to include
    SubjectAltName fields. The two main reasons are Chrome compatibility
    and avoiding a lot of log warnings. This implies that you will have
    to add a new exception in your browser to access the Wazo web
    interface or services like [Unicom](https://phone.wazo.community).

  - If you *did* setup a custom X.509 certificate for HTTPS (e.g. from
    Let's Encrypt), you will have to add a link to the wazo-auth-cli
    configuration using the following
    command.
    
    ``` sourceCode sh
    ln -s "/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml" "/etc/wazo-auth-cli/conf.d/010-custom-certificate.yml"
    ```

  - The Python API for xivo-confd plugins has been updated to reflect
    Python API of other daemons. If you have created a custom xivo-confd
    plugin, you must update it:
    
    ``` sourceCode python
    class Plugin(object):
    
       def load(self, core):
           api = core.api
           config = core.config
    ```
    
    ``` sourceCode python
    class Plugin(object):
    
       def load(self, dependencies):
           api = dependencies['api']
           config = dependencies['config']
    ```

  - The web interface no longer validates the queue skill rules fields
    added in <span data-role="menuselection">Services --\> Call Center
    --\> Configuration --\> Skill rules</span>. If a rule is wrong, it
    will appear in the Asterisk console.

Consult the [18.01
Roadmap](https://projects.wazo.community/versions/271) for more
information.
