# People Xlet features Upgrade Notes

When upgrading your XiVO to 15.19, there are some features in the
directories that could not be upgraded automatically, because it risked
breaking some manual configurations.

After you upgrade your XiVO, your CTI displays in
<span data-role="menuselection">Services --\> CTI Server --\>
Directories --\> Displays</span> may look like this:

You should update your displays to make them look like:
