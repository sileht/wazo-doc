# Service Discovery

## Overview

Wazo uses [consul](https://consul.io) for service discovery. When a
daemon is started, it registers itself on the configured consul node.

[Consul template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) may be
used to generate the configuration files for each daemons that requires
the availability of another service. Consul template can also be used to
reload the appropriate service.
