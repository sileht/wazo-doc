# Profiling Python Programs

## Profiling CPU/Time Usage

Here's an example on how to profile wazo-auth for CPU/time usage:

1.  Stop the monit daemon:
    
        service monit stop

2.  Stop the process you want to profile, i.e. wazo-auth:
    
        service wazo-auth stop

3.  Start the service in foreground mode running with the profiler:
    
        python -m cProfile -o test.profile /usr/bin/xivo-auth -f
    
    This will create a file named `test.profile` when the process
    terminates.
    
    To profile xivo-confgend, you must use this command instead of the
    one
        above:
    
        twistd -p test.profile --profiler=cprofile --savestats -no --python=/usr/bin/xivo-confgend
    
    Note that profiling multi-threaded program (xivo-agid, xivo-confd)
    doesn't work reliably.
    
    The <span data-role="ref">debug-daemons</span> section documents how
    to launch the various Wazo services in foreground/debug mode.

4.  Examine the result of the profiling:
    
        $ python -m pstats test.profile
        Welcome to the profile statistics browser.
        % sort time
        % stats 15
        ...
        % sort cumulative
        % stats 15

## Measuring Code Coverage

Here's an example on how to measure the code coverage of wazo-auth.

This can be useful when you suspect a piece of code to be unused and you
want to have additional information about it.

1.  Install the following packages:
    
        apt-get install python-pip build-essential python-dev

2.  Install coverage via pip:
    
        pip install coverage

3.  Run the program in foreground mode with `coverage run`:
    
        service monit stop
        service wazo-auth stop
        coverage erase
        coverage run /usr/bin/wazo-auth -f
    
    The <span data-role="ref">debug-daemons</span> section documents how
    to launch the various Wazo service in foreground/debug mode.

4.  After the process terminates, use `coverage html` to generate an
    HTML coverage report:
    
        coverage html --include='*xivo_cti*'
    
    This will generate an <span data-role="file">htlmcov</span>
    directory in the current directory.

5.  Browse the coverage report.
    
    Either copy the directory onto your computer and open it with a web
    browser, or start a web server on the Wazo:
    
        cd htmlcov
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    
    Then open the page from your computer (i.e. not on the Wazo):
    
        firefox http://<wazo-hostname>:8000
