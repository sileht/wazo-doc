# User Import and Export

## CSV Import

Users can be imported and associated to other resources by use of a CSV
file. CSV Importation can be used in situations where you need to modify
many users at the same in an efficient manner, or for migrating users
from one system or tenant to another. A CSV file can be created and
edited by spreadsheet tools such as Excel, LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc,
etc.

### CSV file

The first line of a CSV file contains a list of field names (also
sometimes called "columns"). Each new line afterwards are users to
import. CSV data must respect the following conditions:

  - Files must be encoded in UTF-8
  - Fields must be separated with a `,`
  - Fields can be optionally quoted with a `"`
  - Double-quotes can be escaped by writing them twice (e.g. `Robert
    ""Bob"" Jenkins`)
  - Empty fields or headers that are not defined will be considered
    null.
  - Fields of type bool must be either `0` for false, or `1` for true.
  - Fields of type int must be a positive number

In the following tables, columns have been grouped according to their
resource. Each resource is created and associated to its user when all
required fields for that resource are
present.

### Importing a file

Once your file is ready, you can import it via `POST /users/import` to
create all users in the specified tenant using the Wazo-Tenant header.

#### Examples

The following example defines 3 users who each have a phone number. The
first 2 users have a SIP line, where as the last one uses SCCP:

    firstname,lastname,exten,context,line_protocol
    John,Doe,1000,default,sip
    George,Clinton,1001,default,sip
    Bill,Bush,1002,default,sccp

The following example imports a user with a phone number and a
voicemail:

    firstname,lastname,exten,context,line_protocol,voicemail_name,voicemail_number,voicemail_context
    John,Doe,1000,default,sip,Voicemail for John Doe,1000,default

The following exmple imports a user with both an internal and external
phone number (e.g. incoming
    call):

    firstname,lastname,exten,context,line_protocol,incall_exten,incall_context
    John,Doe,1000,default,sip,2050,from-extern

## CSV Update

<div class="note">

<div class="admonition-title">

Note

</div>

The CSV update has been disabled since it does not suport multi-tenants
at the moment

</div>

The field list for an update is the same as for an import with the
addition of the column uuid, which is mandatory. For each line in the
CSV file, the updater goes through the following steps:

1.  Find the user, using the uuid
2.  For each resource (line, voicemail, extension, etc) find out if it
    already exists.
3.  If an existing resource was found, associate it with the user.
    Otherwise, create it.
4.  Update all remaining fields

The following restrictions must also be respected during update:

  - Columns that are not included in the CSV header will not be updated.
  - A field that is empty (i.e, “”) will be converted to NULL, which
    will unset the value.
  - A line’s protocol cannot be changed (i.e you cannot go from “sip” to
    “sccp” or vice-versa).
  - An incall cannot be updated if the user has more than one incall
    associated.

Updating is done through the `PUT /users/import` endpoint

## CSV Export

CSV exports can be used as a scaffold for updating users, or as a means
of importing users into another system or tenant. An export will
generate a CSV file with the same list of columns as an import, with the
addition of uuid and provisioning\_code, for all users in the specified
tenant.

Exports are done through the `GET /users/export`
